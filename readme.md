Hi...<br>
I just wanted to learn typescript.<br>
I am following this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAV69dS1uWRPSfKzwZsIm-Axxq-LxqhW) by the way

To declare some simple variables we don't need to write the type name, because typescript is intelligent enough to detect weather you want to assign a string or a number<br>
And it will still give error if you will assign other types.
